# Bytes Coding Open Source

At Bytes Coding, we are passionate about developing, contributing to, and supporting Open Source projects. As creators and supporters of innovative programming courses and contributors, we firmly believe in the Open Source model's power to foster community collaboration and learning.

## Bytes Coding on GitHub

Our GitHub organization is home to numerous Open Source projects we're actively working on and sharing with the wider community.

## Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all participants in our open source projects and community initiatives. We strive to create safe, welcoming, and positive experiences for everyone. Given that communities reflect the diverse societies they are part of, we are committed to taking positive actions to address inequality and abuses of power.

### How to Behave

- **Be Authentic and Active:** Your genuine participation contributes to the community's health and longevity.
- **Show Consideration, Respect, and Empathy:** We all start somewhere. Respect everyone's journey in technology.
- **Avoid Negative Behaviors:** Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- **Embrace Disagreements Constructively:** Disagreements are part of growth, but argumentative behavior or trolling is not.

### How Not to Behave

- **No Threats or Violence:** Do not threaten or use violent language against others.
- **Avoid Discriminatory Jokes and Language:** Do not engage in sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes or language.
- **No Sexually Explicit or Violent Material:** Do not post or display inappropriate content.
- **Respect Privacy:** Do not post or threaten to post personally identifying information of others.
- **No Personal Insults:** Avoid insults related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- **No Sexual Attention:** Refrain from sexualized comments, jokes, or advances.
- **Do Not Advocate Negative Behavior:** Encouraging unacceptable behavior is not permitted.

Cultural differences and online interactions can sometimes lead to misunderstandings, so empathy is crucial.

### How to Report Issues

If you encounter inappropriate behavior or conduct violations, and direct confrontation is not an option or unwanted, please contact us at info@bytes-coding.com.

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior by any community member will not be tolerated. Expected compliance is immediate when asked to cease such behavior. Depending on the severity, Bytes Coding may take action, including temporary bans or permanent expulsion without warning.
